Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is all about writing instructions for computers and building apps, games, and websites that make our lives better. It helps in solving real-world problems as the world industries in education, manufacturing, and healthcare transition to digital platforms.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i)Generation of software engineering- It was introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering conference to address the software crisis; a period where software was becoming complex. It emphasized the need for structured software development methodologies. It resulted in the development of software lifecycle models such as Waterfall Model.
ii) Rise of object-oriented Programming- it introduced the concept of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism leading to more modernized and reusable code amid traditional procedural programming
iii) The Agile revolution- introduction of the Agile manifesto which emphasized iterative development collaboration and adaptability over rigid planning of software developments.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Planning
Defines the objectives, scope, and feasibility of the project.
Involves requirement analysis, resource allocation, and risk assessment.
Requirement Analysis
Gathers and documents software requirements from stakeholders.
Ensures clarity through Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents.
Design
Creates software architecture, user interfaces, and database structures.
Includes high-level design (HLD) for system structure and low-level design (LLD) for detailed components.
Implementation (Coding)
Developers write code based on the design specifications.
Uses programming languages, frameworks, and development tools.
Testing
Identifies and fixes bugs, errors, and security vulnerabilities.
Includes different testing types such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Deployment
Software is released to the production environment or end-users.
Can be deployed in phases (e.g., beta testing) to ensure stability
Maintenance
Involves bug fixes, updates, and enhancements based on user feedback.
Ensures software remains functional and up-to-date.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is linear and sequential in approach while Agile is iterative and incremental in approach.
waterfall is rigid while Agile is highly flexible.
waterfall has heavy documentation while Agile has minimal documentation.
waterfall is best for the development of a Banking System which requires strict compliance with regulations where detailed documentation and planning are essential while Agile technology is best for Mobile app development which frequently updates on user feedback requiring continuous improvements and feature releases.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- writes and maintains codes for software applications, debugs and fixes errors in software, and implements databases and security features.
Quality Assurance Engineer- tests software to find bugs and ensure quality, develops test cases for manual and automated testing and ensures software meets performance, security, and usability standards.
Project manager- plans and oversees software development projects, manages resources budgets and risks coordinates team, and communicates progress to stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs Importance- combines coding, debugging, and testing tools in one platform, Improves coding efficiency with auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection, and Simplifies debugging with built-in tools. An example is VS code and PyCharm.
VCS Importance- Tracks code changes and allows rollback to previous versions, enabling collaboration among multiple developers, and preventing code conflicts by managing different development branches. An example is GitHub
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging Bugs- Using debugging tools, unit tests, and logs.
Tight Deadlines- Apply Agile, prioritize tasks, and using Trello/Jira.
Keeping Up with Tech- Learning continuously, following trends, taking courses.
Team Collaboration Issues- Using Git, clear documentation, regular meetings.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- test individual components like functions and modules Example is testing a login function separately
Integration testing-tests how different modules work together,example, checking if the login page connects properly to the database
system testing- tests the entire system as a whole, example, running the full banking app to check all features.
Acceptance testing- verifies if the software meets user requirements, determining whether a product is ready for release, example, a client testing e-commerce site before launch.
Importance- Detects and fixes errors early, ensuring smooth functionality and user satisfaction, and reducing future maintenance costs and failures.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Definition- The process of crafting effective prompts to get accurate and relevant AI responses
Importance
Improves Accuracy – ensures clear and precise answers.
Enhances Efficiency – reduces misunderstandings and clarifications.
Customizes Responses – tailors AI output to specific needs.
Optimizes Performance – helps AI understand intent better.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague Prompt- Tell me about technology
Improved prompt- Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare with examples
improved prompt is effective since it is more specific as it focuses on AI in health, and it has clear intent as it requests an explanation with examples.
